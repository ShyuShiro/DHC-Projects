# DHC-Projects
 Projects that I completed at DHC from client to internal projects

This is not intended to be a source of information about DHC secrets. Instead this is to be a place for me to shed more light on the projects and my responsibility with these projects aside from what is seen on my resume.

If the information presented in any of these PDFs is sharing too much -- Please notify me at bjongtran@gmail.com!

1. Pegasi -- A market forecasting algorithm that tied heavily into our facility modeling offering. I was involved in the algorithm creation, all python code, the montecarlo simulation, and the Tableau visualization.
2. Regulatory Writing Tool -- A tool to support regulatory writing in the Cell and Gene Therapy space. I was involved in the ribbon tool and Microsoft Word exclusively, not at all with the template contents. I helped to form the basis on how we would package this as a software for sale, development of the code, the layout of the ribbon and the graphical assets to go along with them.
3. Other projects -- Projects that deserve their own light as well, but I can't share due to NDA or confidentiality reasons.
